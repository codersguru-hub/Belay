# Title

AgentMesh

## One-line Summary

The local trust and memory plane that lets Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, and other coding agents work as one auditable fleet without sharing private chats or plaintext secrets.

## Problem

Developers increasingly run several AI coding agents against the same codebase. Those agents behave like isolated operators: they rescan the same repository, lose important decisions between sessions, collide on files, and sometimes request credentials or production actions through prompt-visible workflows.

Existing orchestrators usually assume they own every agent. That does not fit a developer who deliberately chooses different tools for different jobs. The missing layer is neutral infrastructure that lets independent agents coordinate safely without merging their private conversations or handing one agent authority over the others.

## Solution

AgentMesh is a local-first control plane exposed through MCP. It gives heterogeneous coding agents one bounded view of approved project knowledge, planned work, task ownership, file leases, progress, blockers, and recent activity.

Agents can propose durable project or workspace facts, but those facts remain invisible until a human approves the exact canonical payload digest. Risky commands use the same approval machinery. Secrets stay behind a local encrypted vault and are injected only into registered child processes; known raw and encoded forms are scrubbed from streamed output.

A private Genkit service on Cloud Run uses Gemini 3.6 Flash to explain allowlisted structural metadata. Raw source, secret-shaped content, connection strings, unknown fields, and known secret encodings are rejected locally before any network call. Gemini is an advisory intelligence plane and cannot authorize execution or mutate local state.

## Why This Matters

Multi-agent coding becomes much more useful when agents can operate concurrently, but concurrency without shared state creates expensive rescans, duplicated work, contradictory assumptions, and unsafe mutation paths. AgentMesh turns those independent tools into a governable fleet while preserving their autonomy.

For a solo developer or lead architect, the result is practical: agents see the same approved facts, avoid files another agent owns, continue from durable checklist state, use credentials without receiving them, and leave a correlated audit trail. The product targets the Fortified Enterprise Fleet category as a local Memory Bank, Agent Gateway, security boundary, and observability plane for coding agents.

## How We Used AI

- Codex, Claude Code, Antigravity, and other MCP-compatible agents are the independent operators coordinated by AgentMesh.
- Gemini 3.6 Flash runs through Genkit on a private Cloud Run service and produces structured repository summaries, risk explanations, and **live conflict adjudication** from schema-validated structural metadata.
- **Gemini is reachable from the agent workflow, not just the dashboard.** The `explain_lock_conflict` MCP tool is called by an agent that just lost a file-lock race. AgentMesh sends only agent aliases, repository-relative paths, and the exported symbol kinds of each contended file; Gemini returns which work actually overlaps and a concrete non-conflicting split. This is the one place where a language model is genuinely the right tool: the deterministic engine knows *that* two file sets intersect, but only a model can read the topology and explain *what* the overlap means and what to do instead.
- The local egress guard enforces an exact allowlist and blocks raw source, private-key markers, connection strings, bearer tokens, known secrets and encodings, unknown keys, and oversized payloads before network activity.
- Generative output is labeled with its model, request ID, risk level, and generation time. Cloud failure leaves local coordination, memory, approvals, vault policy, and execution available.


## Key Features

- **Approved semantic memory:** durable project- and workspace-scoped facts with priority, provenance, explicit supersession, collision detection, and a separately bounded pinned context block.
- **Shared workflow state:** auditable checklists with dependencies, owners, progress, blockers, acceptance criteria, and verification evidence.
- **Atomic file ownership:** SQLite WAL transactions provide task leases and repository-relative file locks with exactly one winner for overlapping concurrent requests.
- **Deterministic compact context:** `project://manifest` provides byte-identical structural context with stable hashing, exclusion counters, token estimates, and a strict 3,200-byte ceiling.
- **Secret-safe execution:** AES-256-GCM encrypts environment payloads while `age` wraps the random DEK to a supported local SSH identity. Registered commands run with `shell: false`, minimal environment injection, time/output bounds, and streaming secret redaction.
- **Human-governed mutation:** command and knowledge proposals are bound to canonical SHA-256 digests, expire, accept one authenticated decision, reject replay or mutation, and fail closed after ambiguous restarts.
- **Quiet local cockpit:** React dashboard for agents, checklist state, approved knowledge, active tasks, locked files, audit events, vault posture, manifest metrics, and pending approvals.
- **Privacy-filtered Gemini:** private-IAM Cloud Run service using Genkit and Gemini 3.6 Flash, with local and server-side schema validation and no callback into the local executor.
- **Gemini conflict adjudication:** the `explain_lock_conflict` MCP tool turns a bare lock collision into an explanation of the real overlap plus a non-conflicting split, using only aliases, relative paths, and symbol kinds. It is strictly advisory — it cannot acquire, release, or override a lease — and it always returns the deterministic local split first, so an unconfigured, policy-blocked, or unreachable cloud degrades the answer instead of failing the call.
- **Reproducible proof:** integrated hero flow, no-leak scans, architecture assets, Cloud Run evidence, and documented clean-checkout commands.

## Architecture

Agent clients are treated as untrusted callers. They connect over loopback-only MCP Streamable HTTP to a local TypeScript daemon. The daemon owns canonical paths, SQLite WAL state, project/workspace knowledge, workflow checklists, file leases, indexing, vault state, command policy, approvals, audit events, and cloud egress validation.

The browser cockpit is privileged but secret-free. It receives sanitized local REST/WebSocket projections and a process-local HttpOnly decision token. The cloud intelligence service is separately deployed on private Cloud Run with a dedicated runtime identity. It receives only allowlisted structural metadata, invokes Gemini through Genkit, and has no route back to the repository, SQLite database, vault, or executor.

Architecture upload: `docs/assets/agentmesh-architecture.png` (1440×900 PNG, also available as editable SVG and Mermaid source).

### Technologies Used

TypeScript, Node.js, MCP Streamable HTTP, SQLite WAL, Zod, React, Vite, WebSockets, AES-256-GCM, the `age` CLI, Genkit, Gemini 3.6 Flash, Vertex AI, Cloud Run, Cloud Build, and Vitest.

### Other Data Sources

AgentMesh reads only the selected local repository's allowlisted structural metadata, Git branch/dirty-path metadata, agent-authored checklist and knowledge records, and sanitized local audit events. It does not use external datasets. The cloud service receives a smaller schema-validated projection and never receives raw repository bodies, vault values, private keys, or connection strings.

### Findings and Learnings

- Persistence alone is not shared memory: episodic activity, durable approved knowledge, and planned workflow state need different lifecycles and context budgets.
- Shared memory needs governance. Letting an agent silently write “truth” can amplify one mistaken conclusion across the fleet, so semantic facts use provenance, digest approval, and supersession rather than deletion.
- Exactly-once mutation needs explicit pending, approved, executing, terminal, and indeterminate states; a button and a boolean are not sufficient.
- Deployment packaging is part of the privacy boundary. A narrow Docker image is not enough if the source uploader sends a broader context first, which led us to generate and verify an exact 19-file Cloud Run build context.
- Negative evidence is more useful than a security adjective. The project tests tampering, replay, encoded secret variants, stream boundaries, restart ambiguity, and forbidden cloud payloads.

## Testing Instructions

Requirements: Node.js 22+, npm 10+, and Git on `PATH`. The vault and live cloud smoke paths are optional for basic local verification.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codersguru-hub/AgentMesh.git
cd AgentMesh
npm ci
npm run build
npm test
npm run demo:verify
npm run verify:no-leaks
```

Expected verified baseline:

- Full regression: **46 tests across 11 files, 0 skipped.**
- Hero flow: deterministic manifest, two MCP contenders with exactly one lock winner, durable restart recovery, secret-backed child execution with redacted output, exactly-once approval with replay rejection, one allowed cloud request, and zero forbidden cloud calls.
- No-leak suite: **19 focused tests** across executor security, cloud egress, and the integrated hero flow.
- Manifest reference result: 795 canonical bytes, approximately 199 estimated tokens; timing is measured on each machine rather than hard-coded.

These counts are the actual output of the commands above on a clean checkout of the submitted
revision. If a future commit changes them, treat the command output as authoritative over this
document.

To populate the cockpit with a realistic multi-agent state for review (four connected agents,
two live leases, a genuine lock conflict, a blocked plan item, and pending approvals):

```bash
npm run start
# in a second terminal:
npm run demo:seed
```

`demo:seed` drives the real MCP surface as four independent clients, so the resulting state and
audit trail are genuine rather than fixture data written behind the daemon. It deliberately
leaves the protected command and the knowledge proposals pending, because granting them is the
human authority step.

To run the local cockpit:

```bash
npm run start
# equivalently, from inside the cloned repository: npx agentmesh start --open
```

(`agentmesh` is the repository's own bin entry; AgentMesh is not published to the public npm
registry, so run it from inside the clone rather than as a bare `npx agentmesh` elsewhere.)

Then connect MCP clients to `http://127.0.0.1:3420/mcp` (or use 1-click config snippets inside the Cockpit UI). The cockpit is served at `http://127.0.0.1:3420/`.

## Public Demo Link

**TODO:** Add a hosted project URL if one is prepared. The current product is intentionally a loopback-only local control plane. The private Cloud Run intelligence service is deployment proof, not a public user interface.

## Public Repository Link

https://github.com/codersguru-hub/AgentMesh

**TODO:** Push the final tested revision, verify the public tree contains no sensitive state, and record the final tag/commit SHA here.

## Demo Video

**Required — TODO:** Add the final public YouTube or Vimeo URL.

### Four-minute outline

1. **0:00–0:25 — Problem:** show independent coding agents losing alignment, duplicating context, colliding on files, and requesting dangerous actions.
2. **0:25–1:05 — Shared truth:** one agent reads the pinned knowledge and checklist; another proposes a corrected workspace fact; the cockpit holds it until human approval; the first agent then sees the approved fact.
3. **1:05–1:40 — Concurrent work:** Codex and Claude Code race for an overlapping file set; SQLite produces one winner and one actionable conflict with no partial locks.
4. **1:40–2:25 — Secret-safe action:** run the hero verifier to show an encrypted vault value reaches the child process while raw, Base64, Base64url, hex, and URL-encoded forms remain absent from returned and persisted artifacts.
5. **2:25–3:05 — Human authority:** show the amber protected-command card, exact digest, approve-once behavior, and replay rejection.
6. **3:05–3:35 — Gemini and Cloud Run:** show the private ready revision, labeled Gemini 3.6 Flash result, and a forbidden raw-source/secret-shaped request making zero network calls.
7. **3:35–4:00 — Proof:** show the architecture diagram and verifier summary; close on “shared state, safe execution, human authority.”

The recording should be live and readable at 1080p, show visible Google Cloud proof, and reveal no account identifiers, tokens, browser cookies, identities, vault values, or local Cloud SDK configuration.

## Screenshot Shot List

1. `docs/screenshots/agentmesh-cockpit-approval.png` — pending protected-command approval with requester, target, masked environment names, digest, and policy reason.
2. `docs/screenshots/agentmesh-cockpit-fail-closed.png` — ambiguous execution becomes `indeterminate` and does not silently retry.
3. **TODO:** capture the approved knowledge panel beside a pending knowledge proposal, showing project/workspace scope and provenance without repository-sensitive content.
4. **TODO:** capture exactly-one-winner file contention with owner, path lease, and correlation ID visible.
5. **TODO:** capture a redaction-reviewed Cloud Run ready revision and Gemini smoke result without account identifiers or credentials.

## Known Limitations

- The MVP supports one local developer profile and one machine; it does not provide multi-user identity, cross-machine locks, or enterprise RBAC.
- Agent names are caller-declared rather than cryptographically signed identities.
- The built-in protected-action demo uses a disposable local process; production SSH/SFTP host onboarding, pinned host keys, rollback, and fleet lifecycle management are not implemented.
- The vault's `age` adapter supports readable RSA/Ed25519 SSH identity files, not `ssh-agent` or hardware-backed keys. On Windows, vault-file confidentiality relies on the containing user directory ACL.
- JavaScript cannot guarantee compiler-level memory zeroization; buffers are short-lived and overwritten on a best-effort basis.
- Gemini is advisory and cannot authorize or mutate local state. Cloud unavailability leaves local features operating in degraded mode.
- The Genkit dependency graph carries 59 transitive npm advisories (52 moderate, 7 high, 0 critical), every one of which reports `fixAvailable: false` — they resolve through `@genkit-ai/*` and its OpenTelemetry chain, so no non-breaking upgrade exists. They are scoped entirely to the Cloud Run advisory service: `npm audit --omit=dev --workspace @agentmesh/daemon` reports **0 vulnerabilities**, so the local security boundary that holds the vault, executor, approval gate, and SQLite state is unaffected. The cloud service additionally runs under private IAM, receives only allowlisted structural metadata, and has no route back to the repository, database, vault, or executor.
- Three historical pre-fix Cloud Run source archives remain in the participant-owned Google Cloud project and are disclosed in `docs/hackathon-build/cloud-run-evidence.md`.

## Assisted and Pre-existing Work Disclosure

Ahmed Soliman directed all product, architecture, security boundary, and cloud deployment decisions. AI coding assistants were used to accelerate implementation and testing. Superdesign produced an initial cockpit canvas from an approved design-system reference. Gemini is a runtime feature used only for privacy-filtered structural summaries and did not receive the local repository or vault values. No project code predates the hackathon start.

**TODO:** Ahmed to confirm the pre-existing work statement above before final submission.
