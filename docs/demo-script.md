# Four-minute Belay demo script

## The Winning Demo Formula — video checklist

Judges evaluate submissions largely from the three-to-four-minute video. Use this flow as the recording checklist, and replace any illustrative metric with the value printed by the current verifier before recording.

### The Hook — 0:00–0:30

**Narration:** “When you run Claude Code and Codex on the same project, two things happen: they burn 40,000 tokens rescanning static files, and they can easily leak your plaintext `.env` database secrets into prompt logs. We built Belay—the local control plane that fixes this.”

Keep the token figure only when the recording includes a measured before/after comparison. Otherwise say “tens of thousands of tokens” and show the actual benchmark output.

### The Speed & Context Win — 0:30–1:15

- Run the deterministic indexer.
- Show live timing under 100 ms when reproduced on the recording machine.
- Show the bounded canonical manifest and its estimated token count. The current hero verifier reports approximately 199 tokens; the benchmark fixture may report approximately 275 tokens.
- Explain that the manifest replaces repeated raw repository scans with stable structural context.

### The Multi-Agent Concurrency Lock — 1:15–2:00

- Show Codex claiming `/src/api/auth.ts`.
- Switch to Claude Code attempting to claim the same file.
- Show the immediate conflict rejection, owner/lease information, and stage-context rerouting.
- Emphasize that SQLite WAL and the atomic acquisition transaction produce one winner and no partial lock state.

### The “Wow Moment” — Zero-Leak Intercept & Human Approval — 2:00–3:00

- Have Claude request a protected staging deploy such as `pm2 reload` (the current built-in demo uses a safe local staging-reload simulation).
- Show the Belay cockpit’s amber approval card with the immutable SHA-256 action digest, target, and policy reason. (`demo-staging-reload` itself needs no vault secret, so it shows no masked variable; run `npm run demo:request-vault-approval` for a card that does.)
- Click **Approve** once and show the terminal outcome.
- Run `npm run verify:no-leaks` to prove that the canary secret was not persisted in SQLite, logs, MCP output, dashboard responses, or cloud fixtures.
- To show the fail-closed negative case deliberately, run `npm run demo:request-vault-approval` and approve it: the command needs a vault secret, the vault is locked/unconfigured by default, so execution throws `VAULT_LOCKED` and the approval is recorded `indeterminate` -- not silently claimed as a successful production SSH deployment.

### Google Cloud Run & Gemini Fleet Intelligence — 3:00–3:45

- Enter “Refactor auth to RS256 and add rate limiting” in Studio with **Plan with Gemini** enabled.
- Show the structured Claude/Codex/Antigravity task split, dependency order, risk labels, and assigned lease paths before any agent executes.
- Click **Reserve fleet leases** and show the atomic SQLite-WAL reservation; explain that one conflict rolls the entire fleet plan back.
- Show the Cloud Run revision and Gemini response/request evidence without exposing account identifiers, tokens, cookies, or local gcloud configuration.
- Follow with the negative test showing raw source and known secrets are blocked locally before network transmission.
- State that Gemini is the Cloud Arbiter and fleet-planning intelligence, while local SQLite-WAL remains the enforcement authority; coordination, vault policy, indexing, and approvals continue when cloud intelligence is unavailable.

### Final proof — 3:45–4:00

- Show the final verifier summary, architecture diagram, and repository README.
- Close with: “Belay is the local control plane for shared state, token-efficient context, safe execution, and human authority across heterogeneous coding agents.”

## Before recording

- Use a 1440×960 or 1920×1080 capture with terminal text at least 16 px.
- Start from a clean state directory and the prepared demo repository.
- Keep the Cloud Run console and private service URL ready, but do not show account tokens, environment values, local identities, or `.tools/gcloud-config`.
- Run `npm run demo:verify` once off-camera to confirm the machine is ready.

## 0:00–0:25 — Problem and category

**Visual:** Belay cockpit overview.

**Narration:** “Coding agents are independent operators. They rescan the same repository, collide on files, and ask for credentials through unsafe prompt-visible workflows. Belay is not another orchestrator—it is the local control plane that gives those agents shared rails and a secure execution boundary.”

## 0:25–0:55 — Deterministic context

**Visual:** Run `npm run demo:verify`; pause on manifest metrics.

**Callouts:** byte size, estimated tokens, warm indexing time, stable SHA-256 version.

**Narration:** “Static facts are computed, not generated. The same repository produces byte-identical bounded context. Secret-shaped files and local tool state are excluded before parsing.”

## 0:55–1:30 — Heterogeneous agent collision prevention

**Visual:** Show the two MCP contenders and then the cockpit/task context.

**Narration:** “Codex and Claude Code race for the shared schema. SQLite `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` gives exactly one winner. The other agent receives the current owner, lease, path conflict, and correlation ID—no partial task or lock state.”

## 1:30–2:10 — Zero-leak vault execution

**Visual:** Hero verifier vault section and `[REDACTED]` output; show the artifact scan result.

**Narration:** “The random environment secret is encrypted with AES-GCM, while `age` wraps only the DEK to the local SSH identity. The agent requests a registered command, never a value. The child receives the secret in memory, but raw, Base64, Base64url, hex, and URL-encoded output are scrubbed across chunk boundaries. SQLite, vault, API captures, and cloud fixtures scan clean.”

## 2:10–2:55 — Judge wow moment: approval intercept

**Visual:** [`screenshots/belay-cockpit-approval.png`](screenshots/belay-cockpit-approval.png), then live cockpit if available.

**Narration:** “Claude Code requests a protected staging reload. Belay freezes the exact command, target, working directory, environment names, policy version, and expiry into one SHA-256 digest. Nothing executes while pending. One human decision authorizes that digest once; replay or mutation is rejected.”

Optional negative beat: run `npm run demo:request-vault-approval`, approve the card, and show the resulting `indeterminate` audit entry live -- or use [`screenshots/belay-cockpit-fail-closed.png`](screenshots/belay-cockpit-fail-closed.png) -- and explain that an ambiguous execution never auto-retries.

## 2:55–3:30 — Gemini Cloud Arbiter on Cloud Run

**Visual:** Studio’s `Plan with Gemini` mode produces a three-agent lease plan; then show the Cloud Run ready revision, sanitized request evidence, and local forbidden-egress test.

**Narration:** “Gemini is our Cloud Arbiter and Fleet Intelligence Engine. Before an agent executes, Genkit on private Cloud Run decomposes the goal across Claude, Codex, and Antigravity, assigning dependencies, risk, and required lease paths from sanitized AST topology. The local daemon rejects invented paths and SQLite-WAL still enforces every lease. Raw source or known secrets are blocked locally with zero network calls, and all local controls stay active if the cloud is unavailable.”

## 3:30–4:00 — Proof and vision

**Visual:** Final verifier summary, architecture diagram, repository README.

**Narration:** “Belay proves the infrastructure layer: deterministic context, atomic coordination, secret-safe execution, and human authority across heterogeneous agents. The MVP is local-first and single-user; production SSH fleet adapters and team identity are intentionally next, not falsely claimed today.”

End card: **Belay — shared state, safe execution, human authority.**
